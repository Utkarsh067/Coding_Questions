# In this [Question](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/223339/problem/W), you are given a number N. Initially you have a value equal 1 and you can perform one of the following operation any number of times:

1. Multiply your current value by 10.
2. Multiply your current value by 20.
 
Determine if your value can reach N or not.

**Note: Solve this problem using recursion.**

### Input
First line contains a number T (1≤T≤100) number of test cases.

Next T lines will contain a number N (1≤N≤1012).

### Output
For each test case print "YES" if your value can reach exactly N otherwise, print "NO".

### Example
input:
5
1
2
10
25
200

output:
YES
NO
YES
NO

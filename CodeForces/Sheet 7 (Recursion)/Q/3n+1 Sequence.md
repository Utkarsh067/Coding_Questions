# In this [Question](https://codeforces.com/group/MWSDmqGsZm/contest/223339/problem/Q), you are given a number n, you should print the length of the 3n+1 sequence starting with n.

## The sequence is constructed as follows:
+ If the number n is odd, the next number will be 3n+1.
+ If the number n is even, the next number will be n/2.
+ For example, the 3n+1 sequence of 3 is {3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1} and its length is 8.

**Note: Solve this problem using recursion.**

### Input
